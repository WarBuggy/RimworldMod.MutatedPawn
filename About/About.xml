	<description>Allow any pawn a chance to have random genes with the following configurations:
[list]
[*]3 different chances to have mutations, each with its own max mutation number and chance.
[*]Chance to develop a random mutation for a pawn with a growing carcinoma. Check every 5000 ticks (a day has 60k ticks). Set to 0% to disable this. Thanks Jdalt40 for the suggestion.
[*]Mutated genes can be endogene or xenogene.
[*]Allow archite genes.
[*]The minimum metabolic efficiency allowed, used ONLY by this mod, when deciding a mutation can happen or not. Thank 沙坡村大师 for the suggestion.
[/list]

Mutated genes have yellow border. Thanks to erdelf for suggestions about using ThingComp.

It can be safely added mid-game and should not conflict with any mods. If added mid-game, it does not affected existing pawns.

 I stole some code from Jaxe, who is responsible for Interaction Bubble mod, to make the mod configuration panel scroll-able. Hope he does not mind!

It would be great to receive feedback, suggestions or pointers on how to improve. Hope these mods help!

Cheers!
