	<description>Allow any pawn a chance to have random genes with the following configurations:
[list]
[*]Maximum number of mutations can occur in a pawn (hard limit 10).
[*]The chance for a mutation to occur.
[*]Mutated genes can be endogene or xenogene.
[*]Allow archite genes.
[*]The minimum metabolic effciency allowed, used ONLY by this mod, when deciding a mutation can happen or not. Thank 沙坡村大师 for the suggestion. 
[/list]

New players who are not familiar with intial genes of a xenotype might have problem distiguish original genes from mutated ones. I want to draw a border on mutated genes, but don't know how at the moment. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

It can be safely added mid-game and should not conflict with any mods. If added mid-game, it does not affected existing pawns.

It would be great to receive feedback, suggestions or pointers on how to improve.Hope these mods help!

Cheers!
